# Python API Homework Solution: The assessment of the relationship between Weather and Latitude (OpenWeatherMap API) and Hotel selections at Ideal Weather locations (Geoapify API)

## Background

Leveraged Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer questions related to the Weather and Vacationing across the world.

### Before requesting data from Python API links:

1. I created a new repository in GitHub for this project called `python-api-challenge`. 

2. Inside the new repository:
    * I cloned the new repository to my computer.
    * Inside my local Git repository, I created a directory for this assignment using the folder name Weatherpy.
    * Inside the folder Weatherpy, I added the following content:
      -	A new file called api_key.py, which includes the API keys for OpenWeatherMap API and Geoapify API.
      -	A gitignore file to make sure that api_keys.py is not visible when the python-api-challenge directory on the local drive is pushed to the public Git Hub.
      -	The 2 starter code with Jupyter Notebook extensions, WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb.
      -	A new folder titled Output to included the sample of cities for the Weather and Vacation analyses, with .csv extension.
      -	Several .png plots and 2 .jpg maps
    * I pushed these changes back to GitHub at the conclusion of the analysis. 

### URLs and data files

* WeatherPy assignment: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?units=metric&appid="  
* VacationPY assignment: "https://api.geoapify.com/v2/places"

* python-api-challenge/WeatherPy/Output/city_data.csv - output of cities from the generated of random geographic latitude/longitude coordinates.

### Jupytor Notebook coding files,*.ipynb

* WeatherPy.ipynb - to generate the final analysis and print the plots for WeatherPy assignment
* VacationPy.ipynb - to generate the final analysis and print the maps for VacationPy assignment
